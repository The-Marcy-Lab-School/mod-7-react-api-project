# [Marvel Searcher]

Created by William Zen and Jahmari Maxwell.

## 🚀 Mission statement

Our application, Marvel Searcher is for anyone who loves comics. It allows users to search any comic character name along with the comic that they come from and display that information.

## API & React Router

This application will use the [name of API] API. Below are the documentation and specific endpoints we intend to use and the front-end pages that will use them.

- API endpoint #1 :https://developer.marvel.com/docs#!/public/getCreatorCollection_get_0
  - Fetches list of characters
  - I want to fetch the unique ID of the character, name of the character, thumbnail - representative image for this character

API endpoint #2 :/v1/public/characters/{characterId}/comics
-Fetches the comics’ cover
-I would like to fetch the comic by ID and title of the comic while also displaying the thumbnail of the comic

API endpoint #3 : /v1/public/characters/{characterId}/stories
-Fetchs ‘story’ behind the searched character id
-I would like to fetch the ID, description, and title.


[If your API requires an API key, say so here.]

**Example:**
- API endpoint #1 :https://developer.marvel.com/docs#!/public/getCreatorCollection_get_0

  - I want to fetch the unique ID of the character, name of the character, thumbnail - representative image for this character

API endpoint #2 :/v1/public/characters/{characterId}/comics
- Fetches the comics’ cover

## 👩‍💻 MVP User Stories & Frontend Routes

* The application will feature the following frontend routes and core features:

* On the /home page, users can…
Input a value inside the search bar which will fetch characters through their name

* On the /home page, users can…
View the images of the characters currently searched

* On the /home page, users can…
Once the character is searched users have the option to click” reveal story” to fetch Story{description}

**Example:**
- On the `/artworks` page, users can view a grid of all artwork
- On the `/artworks` page, users can click on a piece of art in the grid, taking them to the details page for that piece of art.
- On the `/artworks/:artworkId` page, users can view additional details for a single piece of art
- On the `/` page, users can search for artwork titles related to a search term.

## 🤔 Stretch User Stories

If time permits, the following stretch features will be implemented in order of priority:

* Users will be able to…
Keep a stored log of their recent searches cascading from most recent to oldest maybe as a small icon or the names in a box somewhere on the screen.

* Users will be able to…
See all instances/characters of relevance to the character's name, multiple boxes showcasing instead of just one.

* Users will be able to…
Users will be able to change the color theme from light mode to dark mode.


**Example:**
* Users will be able to save and view favorited artworks using local storage
* Users will be able to change the color scheme of the website from light mode to dark mode
